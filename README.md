# IVE_FinalYearProject_UnityVR_GAME_GroupProject

This is a group project to make a VR game about fire ecscape. We make this with Unity 3D, write the script with C#.

The file is too big, if you want to view it please view my google drive.
The program cannot fully upload to google drive, but you may kindly see some of our c# code in the game, and check our document and video to know more about this game.
